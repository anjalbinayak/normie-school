        Programming language is the medium to communicate with computer . It is generally easy to learn , understand ,and contains clear concept and logic. Program is the sequnces of instruction along with data. while  executing the program , raw data is processed to a desired output. The program takes in input and produce output. A program that doesnot takes input , seems to be very less useful in the real world . Program deosnot always takes input through keyboard . sometimes input may be keyboard clicks or even mouse movements , etc.
        For example , if you click into link through mouse , then  that click is input , and the page or anythinng it shows to you in return is output.

        There are many programming languages used. Some of them are: 
        <ul>
            <li>Php</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>C#</li>
        </ul>
        These languages are used in their own respective field. Table chart showing the programming language in their own respective fields are :
        <br></p>

        <table border=1>
            <tr>
                <th>Programming Language</th>
                <th> Uses </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Php </td>

                <td>Compiler Design ,Device Drivers, etc</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Java</td>
                <td>Mobile Applications,Mobile Applications,Scientific Applications etc</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        One programming languages can have multiple fields . Like you can see in the table above , Each programming languages have multiple fields and uses. Each Programming language have its own speciality. One might be more secure , but may have memory management issue . One may manage memory but may have security issue .  so, its job of developer to build secure and usable program to solve the problem.
