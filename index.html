            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>Programming language is the medium , to communicate with the computer. It is 
                the set of codes which people use to instruct the computer to perform may tasks.
                Computer cannot understand the natural language . It needs a certain medium to 
                communicate, known as program. Program is a set of instruction which performs atleast
                singular task. Combination of such programs forms a complete software , which is very
                powerful and can solve complex real world problem.<a href='/pages/introduction.html'>..read more</a>

             Today , in the present era , technology is being used day by day for even the most 
             unit task. Every technology we use today, stands with the support of programming language.
            All modern equipents without programming language are just semi conductors and metals.
            All the tasks it performs are coded by programming language. Artificial Intelligence , 
            data science ,  data analysis , robotics , smart home appliances , websites are all product
            of programing language.
